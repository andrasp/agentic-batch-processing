Analyze each image in <repo>/demo/photos and extract what you see.

For people: describe who they are, their expression, what they're doing, approximate age.

For animals: what species, what they're doing, their environment.

For places/scenes: where is it, time of day, weather, notable features.

For all images: note the dominant colors, the overall mood, and what kind of project this image would work well for.

Store everything in <repo>/demo/output/photo_analysis.db

Then create <repo>/demo/output/report.html showing each photo with its extracted data. Add some summary stats at the top.
